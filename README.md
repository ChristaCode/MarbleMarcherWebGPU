# Marble Marcher WebGPU Port

Welcome to the Marble Marcher WebGPU port! This project is an open-source initiative to port the original Marble Marcher game to the web using WebGPU. The port is being developed with SolidJS and the Ambush game engine, which is also under development.

## About Marble Marcher

Marble Marcher is a physics-based game where players navigate a marble through various fractal landscapes. Originally created by [HackerPoet](https://github.com/HackerPoet), the game offers a unique and visually stunning experience.

## Project Goals

- **Port Marble Marcher to WebGPU:** Make Marble Marcher work right in the browser (well, any [browsers that support](https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu) webgpu).
- **Develop the Ambush Game Engine:** This project will use the ambus" game engine, which is being developed alongside the Marble Marcher port. [Check out the ambush engine repository](https://github.com/grinstead/ambush) for more details.
